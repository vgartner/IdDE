# IdDE
IdDE (Integrated and Distributed Development Environment) is a Netbeans' module developed for my master's dissertation, and enables remote distributed collaborative editing (without a server), chatting with translation support (both using XMPP protocol), support for voice conversation (using SIP protocol), file transfer, distributed tasks management and appointment calendar.
