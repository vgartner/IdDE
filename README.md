# IdDE
IdDE (Integrated and Distributed Development Environment) is a Netbeans' module developed for my master's dissertation, and enables remote distributed collaborative editing (without a server), chatting with translation support (both using XMPP protocol), support for voice conversation (using SIP protocol), file transfer, distributed tasks management and appointment calendar.

Developed for Netbeans 6.9. Help is welcome to update to recent versions.
